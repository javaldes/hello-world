Hello. Javaldes here. I find functional programming very interesting and would like to find ways to combine it with objet-oriented programming to produce something useful.

I'm relearning how to program with the current tools of the trade. When I started in computing, Linux was new, Microsoft ruled, and Unix-based systems were the shit, although threatened by cheaper systems made by microsoft's gang. And Sun was alive and trying to push Java. I hated Java from day one and quit programming altogether.

Fast-forward to 2016, thanks to the promises of Erlang, Elixir, Elm and some others, I'm back into it.
